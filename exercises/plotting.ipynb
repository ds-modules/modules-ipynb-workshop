    "The `matplotlib` library has been used extensively for plotting in modules over the last few semesters.

However, the library (while powerful), still comes with a variety of issues that potentially make it more appealing to use another plotting library.\n",

    "1. Confusing/out-of-date documentation\n",
    "2. Unneccessarily complicated code for simple figure modifications\n",

We can also answer any questions you may have."
